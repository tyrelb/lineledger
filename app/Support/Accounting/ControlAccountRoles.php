 *
 * `journal_lines.contact_id` is the AR/AP sub-ledger — the AR/AP aging reports,
 * the contact statements and the cached `ar_balance_cents` / `ap_balance_cents`
 * all read it and nothing else — so a control-account line without the right
 * contact lands in the reports' "unattributed" catch-all. And the balance it
 * settles already includes the tax its originating invoice or bill recorded, so
 * a line settling it must not be taxed again ({@see excludesTax()}).
 *
 * This map is the single definition the forms and the API both gate on.
 *
 * Matched by subtype rather than `is_system`, so per-currency control accounts
 * (see {@see ControlAccountResolver}) are covered too.
