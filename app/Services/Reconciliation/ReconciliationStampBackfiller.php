/**
 * Takes a completed reconciliation's cleared stamp back off the service-charge
 * and interest lines it never counted.
 *
 * Those lines are stamped with their reconciliation the moment they are posted.
 * Until the fix, replacing one mid-edit (or leaving it unticked) kept the stamp,
 * so after completion the register counted a charge the reconciliation had not:
 * the register's cleared balance drifted from the reconciled one, and the
 * replaced charge's reversal came back as a phantom item on the next
 * reconciliation. Completing a reconciliation now removes those stamps; this
 * catches everything completed before.
 *
 * It is deliberately narrow. A line is only un-stamped when it sits on an
 * adjustment entry that very reconciliation posted and is missing from the
 * lines the reconciliation ticked. A reconciliation whose ticked lines do not
 * line up with its stamped ones (a backup restore renumbers lines but not the
 * ticked list) is skipped and reported rather than guessed at. Amounts are never
 * touched. Idempotent — a second run matches nothing.
