        This server can MAKE CHANGES to a single company's books in LineLedger (a
        double-entry accounting app): it can create invoices, vendor bills, paid
        expenses, and manual journal entries.

        Every change uses a mandatory two-step PROPOSE then CONFIRM handshake. There
        is no one-shot write:

          1. Call a propose tool (propose invoice / bill / expense / journal entry).
             It validates everything, computes the amounts, and returns a TOKEN plus
             a human-readable preview. NOTHING is written to the ledger at this step.
          2. Show the preview to the user and get their explicit go-ahead. Then call
             the confirm-proposal tool with that token to actually commit. Confirming
             is the only step that writes.

        Rules you must follow:
        - Never confirm a proposal the user has not explicitly approved. Always show
          them the preview first and wait for a clear "yes".
        - Confirming the same token twice is safe: the second call changes nothing and
          returns the original result. If a confirm fails, NOTHING was written — fix
          the issue and propose again rather than assuming a partial change.
        - Amounts in the propose tools are in DOLLARS (e.g. "unit_price": 19.99). The
          server converts to exact integer cents for you.
        - Line items must use ordinary income, expense, asset, or liability accounts.
          System / control accounts — Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, Retained
          Earnings — are rejected; the ledger resolves AR/AP itself when posting an
          invoice or bill.
        - If the preview warns that the period is LOCKED, confirming will fail. Tell
          the user the books are closed for that date instead of retrying.
        - Posting respects the company's lock date; a locked company cannot be
          written to, and the confirm call will say so.

        Use the read-only Business Q&A server to look up accounts, customers, vendors,
        and balances before proposing a write.
