/**
 * Shared machinery for the agentic (write-enabled) MCP tools. It layers the
 * propose -> confirm safety model on top of the read-only authorization helpers in
 * {@see AnswersBusinessQuestions} (which this trait pulls in), and centralizes the
 * three things every write tool must do BEFORE anything is committed:
 *
 *   1. confirm agentic writes are switched on (operator config flag AND the
 *      per-company opt-in — the same doubly-opt-in pattern as the AI features);
 *   2. refuse any line that targets a system / control account (AR, AP, Retained
 *      Earnings, or anything flagged is_system) — posters resolve those themselves,
 *      so a caller pointing a line at one would double-count or corrupt AR/AP;
 *   3. stage the validated, cents-normalized payload as an {@see McpWriteProposal}
 *      and hand back a token — writing NOTHING to the ledger.
 *
 * The matching ConfirmProposal tool then replays the payload through the real Save
 * action (+ Poster), inheriting the lock-date check and the audit trail from that
 * pipeline. This trait never posts.
 *
 * Edit locks: the BusinessActionsServer tools only CREATE records today, so none
 * of them can collide with a member editing a record in the web app. Any future
 * tool that updates, voids or deletes an EXISTING record must run that write
 * through App\Services\EditLocks\EditLockManager::guardWrite() with a null
 * actor — the same rule as the REST API: refused (the 423 equivalent) while a web
 * user holds the record's edit lock, and the lock's version replaced afterwards.
