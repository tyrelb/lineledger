 * that come out of a ruler laid on the printed page.
 *
 * The numbers below are measured off an Intuit/QuickBooks voucher cheque
 * (standard letter, cheque on top + two stubs), so output drops onto Intuit
 * pre-printed stock without fiddling. The renderer draws the full cheque
 * (data + static labels) by default — print onto blank paper or use it as-is
 * for archive copies. For pre-printed stock, set `draw_static_labels` => false
 * so only data lands in the holes.
